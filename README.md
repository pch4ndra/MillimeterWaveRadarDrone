Radar-based Drone Tracking: The key requirement of drone flight controls is a precise six degree of freedom (6-DoF) tracking system that provides a drone with its real-time location and orientation in 3D space. This project explores a sensor fusion approach including camera, radars, and IMU to provide millimeter-level tracking accuracy.
